# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
### Difficulty: ```Easy```
### Related Topics: ```Two Pointers``` , ```String```

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:

word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

# Solution

## Intuition
We can dry run for loop and pick characters one by one.

## Approach
Iterate through word one by one character and append in the result string. If we reach end for a word don't pick the character.

## Complexity
- `Time complexity: O(max(m,n))` where m and n are length of word

- `Space complexity: O(1)` we haven't use any extra space apart from the result string

# Code
### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int indOfWord1 = 0;
        int indOfWord2 = 0;
        
        int lenOfWord1 = word1.length();
        int lenOfWord2 = word2.length();
        
        int maxLen = Math.max(lenOfWord1, lenOfWord2);
        
        StringBuilder mergedWord = new StringBuilder();
        
        for(int index=0; index < maxLen; index++) {
        
            if(index < lenOfWord1) {
                char x = word1.charAt(index);
                mergedWord.append(x);
            }
        
            if(index < lenOfWord2) {
                char x = word2.charAt(index);
                mergedWord.append(x);
            }
        }
        
        return mergedWord.toString();
    }
}
```
