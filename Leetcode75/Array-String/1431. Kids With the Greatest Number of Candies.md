# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
### Difficulty: ```Easy```
### Related Topics: ```Array```

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```

# Solution

## Intuition
We can dry run two for loop, in first we will find maxCandies and in second we will check after giving extraCandies kid is having more than or equal to maxCandies or not

## Approach
Simple approach first find maxCandies and then check candies for a kid after adding extraCandies.

## Complexity
- `Time complexity: O(n)`

- `Space complexity: O(1)` we haven't use any extra space apart from the result

# Code
### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        int maxCandies = -1;
        for(int candy: candies) {
            if(candy > maxCandies) {
                maxCandies = candy;
            }
        }

        List<Boolean> hasGreatestCandies = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int candy: candies) {
            if(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies) {
                hasGreatestCandies.add(true);
            } else {
                hasGreatestCandies.add(false);
            }
        }

        return hasGreatestCandies;
    }
}
```
