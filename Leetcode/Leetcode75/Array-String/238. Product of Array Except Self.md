# 238. Product of Array Except Self
### Difficulty: `Medium`
### Related Topics: `Array`, `Prefix Sum`

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

**Follow up:** `Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)`

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code
### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] products = new int[n];
        
        int product = 1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            products[i] = product;
            product *= nums[i];
        }
        
        product = 1;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--) {
            products[i] *= product;
            product *= nums[i];
        }
        
        return products;
    }
}
