You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

# Solution

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Simple Approach, Before placing a flower check adjacent, if both are zero place it and move the pointer by 2, because we can't place in next position if we have already placed. But we need to consider some edge cases:

**Case1: Place at First Index** in this case we don't need to check previous flower position.

**Case2: Place at Last Index** in this case we don't need to check next flower position.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code
### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int placed = 0;
        int len = flowerbed.length;
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++) {
            if(flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                if((i == 0 || flowerbed[i-1] == 0) &&
                    (i == len-1 || flowerbed[i+1] == 0)) {
                        placed++;
                        i++;
                    }
            }
        }
        return placed >= n;
    }
}
