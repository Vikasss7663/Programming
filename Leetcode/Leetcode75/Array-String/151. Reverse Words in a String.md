# 151. Reverse Words in a String
### Difficulty: `Medium`
### Related Topics: `Two Pointers`, `String` 

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Follow-up:** `If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?`

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code
### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] tokens = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        
        for(int i=tokens.length-1;i>=0;i--) {
            if(tokens[i].trim().length() > 0) {
                res.append(tokens[i].trim());
                res.append(' ');
            }
        }
        
        return res.toString().trim();
    }
}
